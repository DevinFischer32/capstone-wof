## Approach

I First Built a Figma to have the overall look that I wanted. I then moved over towards the checking/solving features and built them out fully. I left the Three.js Wheel and CSS for the end of the project.

### **Pitch:**

Create an Application where users create an account and can play a Wheel of Fortune game.

### **MVP:**

- Users can create an Account, which is stored in the database.
- Users will guess the random word with just a hint of the word type and size.
- App will display logged-in players' high scores and current scores.
- Players will spin a wheel to get the price per revealed letter they get.
